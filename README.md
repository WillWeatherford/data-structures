# data-structures

This repository contains sample code for a number of classic data structures
implemented in Python.

Singly Linked List:
    Module linked_list.py contains a recursively generated linked list class
    (Linked_List).

Stack:
    Module stack.py leverages the linked_list module to build methods for
    generating a stack, as well as adding and removing items.
